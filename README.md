# JavaScript Exercises

Complete the exercises in this repo and push your solutions up to a branch (`firstname-lastname`).

Using your preferred editor, flesh out the functions in each exercise. You can test your work by running each script in your command line. E.g. `node exercise-1`, while you are in this repository should execute the JavaScript inside `exercise-1.js`.
